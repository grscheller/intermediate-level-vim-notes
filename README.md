# My Neovim Notes

These notes are where I document the information
I learn about vi/vim/nvim.

I tried to put the MarkDown files linked below in
an order where each one only relies on the
gist of the information in the ones before it.

* [Absolute Minimal Text Editing](AbsoluteMinimalTextEditing.md)
* [Basic Text Editing](BasicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](VimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](AdvTradViCommands.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](VimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Multiple Neovim Windows](MultipleWindows.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](EncodingsUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions.md)
* [Configuring Neovim](Configurations.md)

As Neovim goes to version 0.5 and Vim goes to 9.0, I
feel that they are diverging to the point that I need
to target one over the other.  Since I tend to use Neovim
more than Vim, I chose it.
