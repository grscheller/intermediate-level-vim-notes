# Intermediate Level Vim notes
These notes are aimed at the beginning level Vim
user desiring to "up their game" to become
an intermediate level Vim user.

I tried to put the MarkDown files linked below in
an order that only relies on the gist of the
information in ones above it.

* [Basic Text Editing](basicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](vimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](advTradViCommands.md)
* [Multiple Vim Windows](multipleVimWindows.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](vimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](encodingsUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](regExp.md)
* [Configuring Vim](vimrcConfigFile.md)

I have found the act of creating/maintaining these
notes invaluable in my journey to master Vim.

Vim is actually a Turing complete language.  It can be turned
into a complete IDE with full Unix Shell support.  Like EMACS,
Vim is a very powerful editor.  These notes barely scratch the
surface of what Vim can do.
