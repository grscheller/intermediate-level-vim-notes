# Intermediate Level Vim notes
I tried to put the MarkDown files linked below in
an order that only relies on the gist of the
information in ones above it.

* [Basic text editing](basicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](vimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](advTradViCommands.md)
* [Using Multiple Vim Windows](multipleVimWindows.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](vimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](encodingsUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](regExp.md)
* [Configuring Vim](vimrcConfigFile.md)

I have found the act of creating/maintaining these
notes invaluable in my journey to master Vim.

(TL;DR) <- Means "too long, don't read."  Used to mark
interesting background information.  Indicates to reader
material is clearly an aside.
