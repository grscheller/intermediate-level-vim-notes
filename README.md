# My Neovim Notes

These notes are where I document the information
I learn about vi/vim/nvim.

I tried to put the MarkDown files linked below in
an order that only relies on the gist of the
information in ones above it.

* [Basic Text Editing](basicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](vimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](advTradViCommands.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](vimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Multiple Vim Windows](multipleVimWindows.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](encodingsUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](regExp.md)
* [Configuring Vim](vimrcConfigFile.md)

As Neovim goes to version 0.5 and Vim goes to 9.0, I
feel that they are diverging to the point that I need
to target one or the other.  It is not the purpose of
these notes to document the differences.  I chose Neovim
over Vim because of Neovim's active community-driven
development and the refactoring efforts which went into
the codebase.
